### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Eric Bower](https://erock.io)

I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer working at
[@aptible](https://github.com/aptible).

I like to write articles about software engineering.  I spend most of my
time writing front-end code as well as contributing to my side-projects.

I recently launched a list sharing app called [listifi](https://listifi.app).
Check it out if you're interested.

In my spare time I like to build keyboards, longboard, cook, and play video
games.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out if any of these things interest you as well!
