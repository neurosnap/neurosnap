### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Eric Bower](https://erock.io)

<hr style="border:2px solid gray"> </hr>

I enjoy writing articles about my adventures in software development.  I spend
a lot of time thinking about and building side-projects.  I aspire to work on
my own projects full time and am working towards that goal.

Recent projects:

- [lists.sh](https://lists.sh) - A microblog for lists
- [remix-middleware](https://github.com/neurosnap/remix-middleware) -
  An express-like middleware system to help reuse code for your loaders and actions
- [nvim.sh](https://nvim.sh) - searching for neovim plugins in the terminal
  `curl https://nvim.sh`
- [saga-query](https://github.com/neurosnap/saga-query) - An express-like
  middleware system to handle data fetching for front-end apps
- [neovimcraft](https://neovimcraft.com) - A site to help you find the best
  neovim plugins
- [listifi](https://listifi.app) - Share lists with everyone

I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer working at
[@aptible](https://aptible.com).

In my spare time I like to build keyboards, longboard, cook, and hang out with
my wife and kid.
