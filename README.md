### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Eric Bower](https://erock.io)

<hr style="border:2px solid gray"> </hr>

I like to write articles about my adventures in software development.  I am
constantly thinking about new open-source libraries I can build. I spend most
of my time writing front-end code as well as contributing to my side-projects.

My latest OSS project is [saga-query](https://github.com/neurosnap/saga-query)
which leverages koa-like middleware to handle data fetching for front-end apps.

I recently launched [neovimcraft](https://neovimcraft.com) which is a site
dedicated to finding the best neovim plugins and guides for building plugins in
lua.

I also launched a list sharing app called [listifi](https://listifi.app).
Check it out if you're interested.

I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer working at
[@aptible](https://aptible.com).

In my spare time I like to build keyboards, longboard, cook, and play video
games.
